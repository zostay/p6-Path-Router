=NAME Path::Router - A tool for routing paths

=begin SYNOPSIS

  $router.add-route('blog' => (
      defaults => {
          controller => 'blog',
          action     => 'index',
      },
      # you can provide a fixed "target"
      # for a match as well, this can be
      # anything you want it to be ...
      target => My::App.get_controller('blog').get_action('index')
  ));

  $router.add-route('blog/:year/:month/:day' => (

          action     => 'show_date',
      },

=end SYNOPSIS

=begin DESCRIPTION

This module provides a way of deconstructing paths into parameters
suitable for dispatching on. It also provides the inverse in that
it will take a list of parameters, and construct an appropriate
uri for it.

=head2 Reversable

This module places a high degree of importance on reversability.
The value produced by a path match can be passed back in and you
will get the same path you originally put in. The result of this
is that it removes ambiguity and therefore reduces the number of
possible mis-routings.

=head2 Verifiable

This module also provides additional tools you can use to test
and verify the integrity of your router. These include:

=item An interactive shell in which you can test various paths and see the
match it will return, and also test the reversability of that match.

=item A L<Test::Path::Router> module which can be used in your applications
test suite to easily verify the integrity of your paths.

=head2 Validated and Automatically Coerced

Each path may use one or more variables, each given a validation. If a numeric
type is used, the value passed on to the action will also be coerced into the
correct value.

=end DESCRIPTION

=head1 Methods

=head2 method add-route

    method add-route(Str $path, *%options)

Adds a new route to the I<end> of the routes list.

=head2 method insert-route

    method insert-route(Str $path, *%options)

Adds a new route to the routes list. You may specify an C<at> parameter, which would
indicate the position where you want to insert your newly created route. The C<at>
parameter is the C<index> position in the list, so it starts at 0.

Examples:

    # You have more than three paths, insert a new route at
    # the 4th item
    $router->insert_route($path => (
        at => 3, %options
    ));

    # If you have less items than the index, then it's the same as
    # as add_route -- it's just appended to the end of the list
    $router->insert_route($path => (
        at => 1_000_000, %options
    ));

    # If you want to prepend, omit "at", or specify 0
    $router->insert_Route($path => (
        at => 0, %options
    ));

=head2 method include-router

    method include-router (Str $path, Path::Router $other_router)

These extracts all the route from C<$other_router> and includes them into
the invocant router and prepends C<$path> to all their paths.

It should be noted that this does B<not> do any kind of redispatch to the
C<$other_router>, it actually extracts all the paths from C<$other_router>
and inserts them into the invocant router. This means any changes to
C<$other_router> after inclusion will not be reflected in the invocant.

=head2 has $.routes

=head2 method match

    method match(Str $path)

Return a L<Path::Router::Route::Match> object for the first route that matches the
given C<$path>, or C<undef> if no routes match.

=head2 method uri-for

    method uri-for(*%path_descriptor)

Find the path that, when passed to C<< $router->match >>, would produce the
given arguments.  Returns the path without any leading C</>.  Returns C<undef>
if no routes match.

=head1 Debugging

You can turn on the verbose debug logging with the C<PATH_ROUTER_DEBUG>
environment variable.

=begin DIAGNOSTIC

=head2 X::Path::Router

All path router exceptions inherit from this exception class.

=head2 X::Path::Router::AmbiguousMatch::PathMatch

This exception is thrown when a path is found to match two different routes equally well.

=head2 X::Path::Router::AmbiguousMatch::ReverseMatch

This exception is thrown when two paths are found to match a given criteria when looking up the C<uri-for> a path

=head2 X::Path::Router::BadInclusion

This exception is thrown whenever an attempt is made to include one router in another incorrectly.

=head2 X::Path::Router::BadRoute

This exception is thrown when a route has some serious flaw, such as a validation for a variable that is not found in the path.

=end DIAGNOSTIC

=for BUG
All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug
