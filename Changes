    * COMPATIBILITY BREAKING: Prior to this revision, .add-route(...) allowed
      the options part of the argument to be specified as a list of pairs rather
      than always as a hash. This was a mistake. The second argument, regardless
      of whether it is passed using the two argument multi or as a list of
      pairs, the options must always be passed as a hash.
    * COMPATIBILITY BREAKING: The X::Path::Router::BadRoute exception has been
      renamed to X::Path::Router::BadValidation, which inherits from
      X::Path::Router::BadRoute.
    * Add support for UInt coercion in validation.
    * Adding support for slurpy parameters using * and +.
    * A new X::Path::Router::BadSlurpy exception has been added.
